Folk often ask me about difficulties soldering. Soldering is fundamental to electronics but it can be very, very tricky - even for people with many years of experience - here are some things that help:

#### Is the tip tinned?

Is the tip of the soldering iron tinned? If not, I've got tip cleaner and tinner (LÃ¶tspitzenreiniger or LÃ¶tkolbenspitze Tinner Activator in German) to help with this.

#### In the tip clean?

Is the tip clean? Wiping the tip of the soldering iron on a small sponge soaked in distilled water is the traditional technique and can be an enormous help - wiping in good quality brass wool is a newer alternative.

#### Could a glue help?

Different sorts of glue are used frequently in electronic manufacture. For hand soldering of small components, glues are typically used in very tiny quantities and put in place using a very fine syringe applicator so that the glue can hold the component in place but not contaminate the solder pads. Electronic glue manufacturers give summaries of the applications for each sort of glue - the manufacturers favor their own products but many of them provide multiple glue chemistries and so can give a balanced summary of the applications of each and the advantages and disadvantages of each - for example:

#### Are fumes a problem?

If so, let me know and I'll bring a solder fume extractor. Some people aren't affected by solder fumes but some people are allergic to them or become allergic over time - sensitivity and symptoms very strongly depending on the person but typical symptoms can include running nose, irritated eyes, headaches, etc. It's easy to see the smoke from flux but other less visible and more allergenic fumes are also present when plastic components close to the soldering operation are accidentally heated during soldering.

#### Is the temperature set correctly?

Is the soldering iron set to the correct temperature for the solder? Too high a temperature causes the flux to evaporate before it can do it's job and damages the tip of the soldering iron while too low a temperature means that the solder doesn't flow properly.

#### Is it good quality solder?

It's well worth buying solder only from high quality manufacturers and dealers - 10 Francs saved on cheap solder can cause hours of frustration, burned fingers, damaged circuit boards and damaged components.

#### Is the solder wire fine enough?

For delicate soldering operations fine soldering wire (0.5 mm or less) is better than wider soldering wire.

#### Would solder paste be better?

Is solder wire or solder paste best for your application? For small surface mount devices solder paste then a soldering iron or hot air soldering can be easier than wire. To hold a surface mount component in place during soldering consider whether a tiny amount of glue would help.

#### Is the soldering iron the right size?

In general, soldering irons with very small, fine tips for delicate things and large, powerful soldering irons for larger things.

#### Would pliers or forceps help?

A pair of small, fine electronic pliers or forceps can be a big help to conduct heat away from parts that you don't want to get hot and to hold things during soldering - when holding things becomes really tricky also consider a tiny amount of glue (above).

#### Are the surfaces clean?

Make sure that the surfaces to be soldered are clean. Small pen-style cleaners with fine glass wool core are perfect for this - if one of these isn't available then a small piece of very fine sandpaper is an option - fine steel wool can be used but this is not recommended because tiny fragments of steel wool can short-circuit delicate electronics. After physical cleaning, a layer of flux in solvent keeps the surface fresh and safe from oxidation.
