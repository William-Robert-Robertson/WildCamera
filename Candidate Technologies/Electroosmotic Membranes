For ROSAHL PD2 Electric Micro Dehumidifier

  Use a constant voltage 2.9 to 3.3 Volt DC supply which can provide up to 500 mA
  Because the PD2 takes a high initial inrush current it should have its own independent supply.
  (It should should not be supplied from the same power supply as logic circuits because of the high initial inrush current and should not be supplied from a constant current supply.)

  The terminal with the "indication of polarity" spot is the positive terminal.

  Use M12 x 0.5mm nut (M12 with 0.5mm pitch)
  for example:

  I noticed that the instructions for the PD2 suggest that care is needed when silicone gasket materials are used which may emit traces of oxime or siloxane gasses and that secondary heat treatment at 200 Â°c for 6 hours may be needed where these are involved ("Recommended Materials" on page 6 of the data sheet enclosed with the PD2).
