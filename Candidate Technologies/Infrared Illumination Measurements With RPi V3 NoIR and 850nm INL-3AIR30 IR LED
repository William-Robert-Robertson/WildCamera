Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 NoIR (IR filter removed from camera module)

Target: human hand at 200 to 300 mm from camera

Filters tested

Kenko Optical Filter
Kenko UV 72mm Japan

and

dHD UV Filter 62mm

Scame Serie SCABOX
Junction box - Grey
IP56 240x190x90mm

Clear plastic cover of box and glass UV filters above were found to cause no severe attenuation of IR light at 850nm.

Overall potical performence was good.
