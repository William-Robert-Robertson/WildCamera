Raspberry Pi 4 B Power Consumption

# More details in spreadsheet:
# PRi 4 B and Camera Module V3 - Storage Power and Energy Consumption

# The 7 inch LCD Touchscreen consumes c. 3 to 4 W of power so is disconnected in the following tests:
# WiFi network and ethernet not connected during tests:
# RPi 4 SBC used because the RPI 5 SBC does not have a hardware video encoder and RPi Zero 2 W cannot currently handle the frame rate and resolution required.
# SD Card is 128 GB Samsung Evo Plus A3 V30
# Default RPi image with no ammendments.

# RPi 4 SBC with RPi V3 Camera connected
#   c. 1.77 to 1.86 W when idle

# Task:
# Record, compress and store HDR 1080p video from RPi V3 camera to .mp4 file for 8 hours.
# --codec libav 
# --width 1920 
# --height 1080 
# bitrate -b 9000000 (default units for bit rate are bits (not bytes) per second)
# --framerate is not specified so default 30 fps will be used.
# --save-pts - Attempt to save timestamp for each frame - this is not supported by the libav codec

# Notes:

#    for more info on libav codec see https://ffmpeg.org/libavcodec.html
#    possible codecs are:
#    h264 - H.264 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) - max. 1920 x 1080 - supported by most moderen hardware video encoders.
#    libav - default is H.264 within an mp4 file.
#    mjpeg - generally not as good compression efficiency as H.264
#    yuv420 - uncompressed
