DEBIX Model A Industrial Single Board Computer
  https://debix.io/hardware/model-a.html
This is part of the DEBIX N Series SBCs
  "There are low-cost development
  boards, such as the Debix Model A that we use for development (note that
  its camera connector is not standard, but they have a Debix I/O board
  that can interface the Model A camera connector to a Raspberry Pi 15
  pins connector)."

  Hello @Will_Robertson 
  You can refer to the following examples project using Sony IMX335 5MPx CMOS camera with CSI.
  These demos also use VENC. 
  Bare metal version:
  STM32Cube_FW_N6_V1.0.0\Projects\STM32N6570-DK\Applications\VENC\VENC_SDCard
  ThreadX version:
  STM32Cube_FW_N6_V1.0.0\Projects\STM32N6570-DK\Applications\VENC\VENC_SDCard_ThreadX
  Best regards,
  Romain,
