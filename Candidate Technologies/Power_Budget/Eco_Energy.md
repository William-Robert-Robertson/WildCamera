| Characteristic | Vlaue |
| --- | --- |
| Consumption | 0.2 mA at night, 0.6 mA daytime standby, 2.5 mA when charging  |
| Maximum input | 25 volts (12V control), 50 volts (24V control) |
| Maximum charging current | 5 Amps DC |
| Regulation method | Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), Positive side switching |

Note that the above appear to be PWM and not MPPT controllers.

The above could be used together with a low voltage disconnect to protect the battery from over-discharging e.g. \
