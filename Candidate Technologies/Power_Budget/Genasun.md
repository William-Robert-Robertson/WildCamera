Prior-Jones _et al._ 2025: \
"The Genasun GV-4, Genasun GV-5 and Eco Energy ASC30W offer the best overall performance, allowing the use of a 5 Ah battery, with a mass of <2 kg. Choosing one of these best-performing regulators results in a 26× reduction in battery mass and a 13× reduction in battery price when compared with the Victron MPPT 75/10." \
Genasun GV5 PbA c. 0.12 mA at 12 V measured by Prior-Jones _et al._ 2025 so c. 1.44 mW

Genasun GV-5 data sheet:
Operating Consumption: 0.150 mA (150 uA)
Night Consumption: 0.125 mA (125 uA)
Maximum Input Short Circuit Current1: 5 A
Maximum Input Current2: 9 A
1) Panel Isc. Maximum input power and maximum input voltage requirements must also be respected.
(2) Maximum current that the controller could draw from an unlimited source.
