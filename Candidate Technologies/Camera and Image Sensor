"MIPI Camera CSI" under "Video Capture drivers" in the release notes for the current IMX Linux version 
https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/release-note/IMX_LINUX_RELEASE_NOTES.pdf 
lists image sensors.
For the March 2025 version of IMX Linux this reads:
"Supports 2-lane CSI MIPI camera OV5640 with 720p30, 640x480@30, 320x240@30, 720x480@30, 1080p@30, 2592x1944@15, 176x144@30.
Supports CSI MIPI camera OV10635 with 1280x800@30, ov10635 max supports 1280x800@30, and ISI does not support upscale, so 1080p, 2592x1944 cannot be supported on i.MX 8QuadMax and 8QuadXPlus.

Linux Start Guide for ST BrightSense image sensors - Rev 1 - May 2024
https://www.st.com/resource/en/product_presentation/linux-startguide-stbrightsense.pdf
  ST BrightSense, "This Linux Start Guide covers all the products of the ST BrightSense portfolio, which includes at the time of writing"
  "Every ST BrightSense image sensor is available with two main hardware kit options, which both contains the necessary board,
  optics and a 22-pin FFC/FPC cable."
  S-Board
    "The S-Board is a hardware kit including a sensor board for a given image sensor, that is equipped with M12 lens holder and
    removable lens, enabling user to change lens at any time."
  P-Board
    "The P-Board is a hardware kit including a board with connector to evaluation any camera module provided by STMicroelectronics
    and its authorized partners. This kit enables to evaluate image sensors built as turnkey camera module to save the effort
    associated to lens selection and focus."
    "P-Board has no image sensor - None (promodule to order separately)"
  "Complementing V4L2 is libcamera. It operates as a user-space library and provides a unified interface for camera applications"
  "Raspberry Pi"
  "By default, Raspberry Pi OS comes with Libcamera library. Using Libcamera allows to benefit from Broadcom HW ISP
  available on the RPi SoC for image processing (debayering, 3A, etc.)."
  "Each Image Sensor must be described in Libcamera. For that reason, the RPi OS Libcamera package should be upgraded
  with a new version where all ST BrightSense Image Sensors are described"
  "Once the libcamera package has been downloaded from st.com it can be installed with the below command line:"
  $ sudo dpkg -i libcamera-ipa_0.2.0.deb
  "While some embedded platforms such as the Raspberry Pi series rely on Libcamera as a camera software library, other Linuxbased plat or s on’t ene it ro it and only support V4L2. In such situation, standard V4L2 tools must be used to
  communicate with the image sensor."

VD56G3 Compact and high-sensitivity 1.5 megapixel monochrome global shutter image sensor
  https://www.st.com/en/imaging-and-photonics-solutions/vd56g3.html
  "Benefits both visible and NIR imaging (850 nm and 940 nm)."
  "Multiple features to optimize data size and frame rates such as crop, binning, and programmable sequences."

It looks like ST are mentioning a lot about MIPI CSI-2 in the summary information about their newest image sensors - this seems to suggest the likelihood of a commitment to CSI-2 throughout their ecosystem.

  camera modules supported by mainline Linux kernel drivers!
  "Insights on Raspberry Pi 5 and Sony IMX Sensor Integration"
  "Fri Mar 01, 2024 5:56 pm re: 1. We have moved to an entirely open-source camera stack. Therefore, you should be able to write your drivers for any MIPI CSI camera. There are already several cameras already supported in the Linux kernel. If you have registers sets etc then it's quite possible. Check out the drivers already in the kernel tree for ideas."
  "Fri Mar 01, 2024 6:08 pm 1. As JamesH has said, the camera stack is now entirely open. We have support for a number of 3rd party camera modules by just using the mainline Linux kernel drivers for them (eg IMX327/290/462 family, IMX258, IMX296, OV7251, OV9281/2)."
