Temperature Range

A temperature range for the STM32N6570-DK could not be found but a temperature range for the STM32N657I0 is stated:

>The devices offer an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals, and operate in the **-40 to +125°C temperature range**, from 1.71 to 3.6 V power supply. A comprehensive set of low-power modes (Sleep, Stop, and Standby) allows the design of low-power applications.
