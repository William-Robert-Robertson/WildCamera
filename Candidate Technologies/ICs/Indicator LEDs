Note that for final prototype a much wider range of SMT LEDs is available than TTH LEDs runnign from 3.3 V

It appears that the i.MX 8M Plus can drive up to 82.5 mA

"A1: Yes, this feature is the Drive Strength Field (DSE) for 3.3V goes from 40 - 255 Ohm."
"A3: This is calculated in terms of buffer impedance, so to say in case of the lower impedance (40 ohm) the maximum current provided is roughly 82.5mA,"

DSE Drive Strength Field

001 255_Ohm
010 105_Ohm
...
111 40 Ohm
"Q1: If DSE is 001 and VDD is 3.3V then the current I can source or sink through that pin would be equal to 3.3V/255Ohm = 12.9mA ? or is there more to it that needs to be considered?"
"Q1: Yes, that is correct, and it is the only thing you need to consider. You can use this thread as reference." - "this" links to the thread above
"So just to be clear, does this means that even if I connect 3.3V supply directly to I/O pin and set the pin as output and drive it as low (or vice versa i.e. connect GND to I/O pin and drive it high), the amount of current that will flow will limit by this series resistance / output impedance and will not be a short circuit?  "
"Yes, that is correct. But it is recommended to limit that current and do not "short circuit" the GPIO on that way."
