Battery Management

TI provide this that supports multiple battery chemistries:

A kernel driver exists for the BQ34Z100

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/power/supply/bq27xxx_battery_i2c.c

or this one for lead acid only (lead acid is still by far the most reliable battery chemistry at low temperatures)

AD seem to do a lot in this area as well:
