LiFePO4

"Charging lithium batteries in temperatures below freezing, particularly with inappropriate charge rates, can compromise the mechanical stability of the battery, making it more susceptible to sudden failure. The loss of lithium ions within the graphite anode during freezing charging conditions can lead to plating, further reducing battery capacity and increasing resistance. Significant plating accumulation can potentially puncture the separator and create a hazardous short circuit within the battery cell.
To mitigate these issues, it is crucial to avoid charging lithium batteries in freezing temperatures, especially at high charge rates. Employing proper low-temperature charging protection mechanisms can help maintain the battery's performance and prevent potential damage caused by excessive plating."

"The self-heating series from Redodo consists of two models: the 12V 100Ah self-heating battery and the 12V 200Ah self-heating battery, both utilizing LiFePO4 lithium technology. These batteries are specially designed with built-in heating pads, which is the key differentiating feature of this series. With heating pads installed on two sides of the battery, they provide effective heating capabilities and comprehensive protection for your battery."

"When charging lithium iron phosphate batteries below 0°C (32°F), the charge current must be reduced to 0.1C and below -10°C (14°F) it must be reduced to 0.05C."

As an example: \
537.6 Wh \
Self Discharge <3% per Month \
Charge Temperature 0 ~ 45 °C \
Discharge Temperature -20 ~ 60 °C
Calculated c. 105 Wh per kg \
Self-discharge of 3% of 537.6 Wh battery gives 16.128 Wh per month self-discharge.
