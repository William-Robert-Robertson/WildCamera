Phytec\
phyCORE-i.MX 8M Plus Power Consumption\
lists power consumption in all scenarios as "TBD" as of September 2025\
https://www.phytec.de/cdocuments/?doc=fAC7E

Phytec documentation includes an important warning:\
"It is necessary to avoid voltages at the IO pins of the phyCORE-i.MX 8M Plus which are sourced from the supply voltage of peripheral devices attached to the SOM during power-up or power-down. These voltages can cause a current flow into the controller, especially if peripheral devices attached to the interfaces of the i.MX 8M Plus are supposed to be powered while the phyCORE‑i.MX 8M Plus is in suspend mode or turned off. To avoid this, bus switches either supplied by VDD_3V3 on the phyCORE side or having their output enabled to the SOM controlled by the X_nPWR_READY signal (see Supply Voltage for External Logic) must be used."
