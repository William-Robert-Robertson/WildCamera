  Recording in response to a signal
  For those familiar with Linux signals, an alternative to pressing a key is to send a signal instead. To do this, simply use -s or --signal instead of -k (or --keypress).

  To send a record/pause signal to libcamera-vid, first start it and then type the following into another terminal window:

  kill -SIGUSR1 `pidof libcamera-vid`

  And you can force libcamera-vid to quit with:

  kill -SIGUSR2 `pidof libcamera-vid`

  Note: User Signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 mentioned at 18:00 of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU0ULe2f6hI

  This should be familiar as it matches libcamera-stillâ€™s behaviour!
