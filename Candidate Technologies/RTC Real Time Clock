RTC Real Time Clock

Note: RPi 5 has an RTC but no hardware video encoder, RPi 4 has a hardware video encoder but no RTC. 
Note: Debix Model A does not include an RTC but the Debix IO Board does

DEBIX IO Board User Manual-V1.1.pdf
  states:
  "RTC chip model is HYM8563S, I2C address is 0x51"
  On Debix IO Board circuit board "BM8562" is U9 (very difficult to read) - right next to X1
