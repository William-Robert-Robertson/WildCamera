>The ISP firmware is configurable by licensing THine’s camera development kit separately to design camera systems using the customer’s preferred image sensor.

>The THSCM101 Kit interfaces to NXP’s i.MX 8M family EVKs and is based on THine’s THP7312-P image signal processor (ISP) and Sony’s IMX258 13MP CMOS PDAF image sensor. The Kit includes a Camera Board, a Mini-SAS cable to directly connect the Camera board to NXP i.MX 8M family EVKs’ CSI port, and all required software to stream images. The Kit can be easily set up to stream images by connecting it to the NXP i.MX 8M EVK or i.MX 8M Mini EVK using the SD card image available at THine Solutions’ website which includes the Video4Linux2 (V4L2) driver to control various video functions. THine’s optimized ISP firmware provides high image quality that is repeatable in every unit for use in high volume production. The Linux driver, SD card image, and reference circuit schematics can all be made available to interested customers. In addition, customization of the Kit is easily achievable using THine’s GUI based Software development tools. As a result, the THSCM101 accelerates customers’ time-to-market without expensive initial costs for developing embedded camera systems with a Linux platform.

>Until now, the typical camera choice available for NXP i.MX 8M family EVKs is a 5MP image sensor camera with embedded ISP and no capability for image customization nor production scalability. In addition to increasing the image resolution from 5MP to 4K2K (and potentially to 13Mp with software upgrades),
