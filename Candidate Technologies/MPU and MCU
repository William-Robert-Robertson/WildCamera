https://community.st.com/t5/stm32-mpus-boards-and-hardware/stm32mp257-som-sip-or-sbc/m-p/754923

ST understand the relative advantages of System-on-Module (SoM) System-in-Package (SiP) and fully discrete for STM32:
  https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/support/learning/stm32-education/scalable-solutions-stm32mp1-mpu-design.html
ST have a list of partners providing SoM and SiP here:

and products here
  https://www.st.com/en/partner-products-and-services/hardware-integrated-devices-from-partners/products.html
  This can be filtered by device - as of 16 December 2024 stm32mp157 is a filter option but stm32mp257 isn't.
Engicam produce SoM and SiP for other STM32 devices e.g. the i.Core STM32MP25

  2 x MIPI CSI
  Power Input 3.5V~5V/2A
  Note: DEBIX A SoM exposes 2 MIPI CSI-2 interface and DEBIX A SBC exposes only 1 MIPI CSI-2 interface
DEBIX SOM A I/O Board BMB-08

  Power Input DC 12V/2A for default, support wide voltage range of DC 12V~36V

  2.2.5. MIPI CSI on p36 of 118 says "2*10 Pin / 1.25 mm header"
  2.2.6.2. Audio Internal Interface on p41 of 118 says "There is a 2*5Pin audio internal interface (J14), in addition to the internal pins of theheadphone and microphone input combination interface (J13)"
  This is confirmed by:

  "20pin/1.25mm MIPI_CSI socket"
  This looks like a 2 mm header rather than a 2.5 mm header but this isn't clear.

Support for the H.264 Video Encoder on the i.MX 8M Plus is expected to be added to libcamera during 2025
The h.264 encoder an IP core from verisilicon, called vc8000e
sometimes abbreviated to vc8ke
support is being developed in a driver called hantro

The Hantro VC8000E video encoder is referreed to here:
RM00294 - i.MX VPU Application Programming Interface Linux Reference Manual
"1.2 Hantro
The Hantro VPU on the i.MX 8M series includes both decoder (G1/G2) and encoder (H1/VC8000E). The early
VPU wrapper interface (deprecated) is built based on Hantro user library, which communicates with the Hantro
kernel driver directly. To support the V4L2 interface, one V4L2-based kernel driver is implemented and one
daemon application is designed accordingly to link the V4L2 driver and Hantro user library."

  Times are from beginning ofthe webinar not Naushir Patuck's part of the webinar:
  18:40 Hailo 8 26 TOPS versus Hailo 8 L 13 TOPS - both of these connect over the PCIe link with the Raspberry PI and because of this they're only compatible with Raspberry Pi 5
  22:10 you can run the very same models on the CPU but instead of 30 FPS you'd be running at 1 or a half FPS - like a 30 times speed up at least in these cases here
  27:00 Raspberry Pi AI Camera - AI HAT can only be used on Rapberry Pi 5 because of PCIe thing - Raspberry Pi AI Camera can be run on any Raspberry PI - IMX500 has AI built-in - up to 2 TOPS - in-line with the sensor frame so very low latency - including the Pi Zeros
  39:40 Q&A begins
  39:44 Will the RPi camera work with Pico? Right now no because we use a standard RPi camera connector - there's no socket on the Pico 2 W that attaches to this interface - we're looking at this to see what we can do 
  45:30 Power consumption? Depends on workload 1 to 1.5 W for AI Camera typically at 30 FPS object recognition network, for AI Hat boards higher closer to 2 to 2.5 W range.
  47:00 Synchronisation? For GS cameras electronic connection. Still working on software synchronisation for V3 cameras - still in beta
  53:00 OpenCV? Indirectly yes - OpenCV does not interface directly with libcamera - opening a camera source in OpenCV is possible but not easy - working with OpenCV team to integrate libcamera directly with their library
  56:50 PCIe? Only one PCIe connector on the board - either the AI HAT or M.2 drive the would occupy that - can buy 3rd party PCIe switch hat for multiple PCIe devices.
  61:05 End.

  For RPi Zero 2 it looks like the video pipeline on it - and particularly the encoder - is too slow for a wildlife camera:
  "For anyone working with webcams or other video footage, the good news continues: Video transcoding is now possible, at least if you're happy to drop the resolution or frame rate down a bit, with the Zero 2 W hitting an average of 19 frames per second using the hardware H.264 encoder via v4l2 when encoding a 1080p video — compared to the original Zero's paltry 1.2 FPS. To get over 30 FPS at that resolution, though, still requires a Raspberry Pi 4."

Microchip SAMA7G54
  It's a MPU with a CSI-2 interface and is also aimed at low power consumption according to
  https://www.elektormagazine.com/news/first-single-core-mpu-with-mipi-csi-2-camera-interface-and-advanced-audio-features
  "Microchip is committed to maintaining the lowest power MPU portfolio in the market. The SAMA7G54 extends this low-power trend into the 1GHz performance class of Linux®-capable MPUs by providing flexible low-power modes, as well as voltage and frequency scaling."
  Obviously, adoption will be greatly enhanced by the marketing genius at Microchip who wants 350 EUR to shove the thing on a circuit board:
  https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV21H18A
  Microchip do produce a SOM based on it for 70 EUR 
  https://www.microchipdirect.com/dev-tools/EA16Z43A
  Or 3 for 200 USD:
  https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ea16z43a
  but:
    "It is not recommended to use industrial automated reflow process with oven to solder the product on the mother board, as the process might impact the System-On-Module reliability.
    Work Around: Solder the System-On-Module on the mother board manually."
    I'm not sure if it can be treated as a competitor given that there's no built-in WiFi (another module has to be added for that) and the soldering problem with the SOM (I'd thought that SOM manufacturers had solved that some time ago - sometimes simply by popping a metal can over most of the SOM).
    With the soldering problem with the SOM the only way to get the thing into a production design would be if Microchip provide good PCB reference design files.
    The SAMA7G54 is over 2 years old now so Microchip may have produced something newer.

  https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/introducing-raspberry-pi-5/#comment-1594055
  "Ok, this is a big one… The problem is that video encoding is not a standard. You can put as much or as little effort into encoding as you like, on Pi 1, 2, 3, & 4 the encoding quality (for the bitrate) was relatively poor. The nice thing about using the processors to do this is you get to choose exactly what balance between quality and bitrate you want. Obviously, the bad thing is the power consumption, but actually it only takes around 1 processor to encode 1080p60 with our default settings (which is still better quality than the PI 4 hardware encoder). We think it might be possible with the right settings to be able to hit 4K encode at around 24fps, but we’ve not been optimising in that direction yet.
  In future we’ll have to do something, but for Pi 5 we feel the hardware encode is a mm^2 too far."
