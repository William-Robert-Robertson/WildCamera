Solar Power Estimates

This paper roughly estimates that "approximately 9â€‰% of the open-field radiation reached the forest floor"

So that 180 W solar panel would give about 18 W on the forest floor in theoretical ideal conditions - the reality is likely to be a lot lower than that though.

"To convert millilangleys (mly) to joules per square metre
(J / m2 ), multiply by 41.84."

  Flux density millilangleys per minute
  c. 40 difuse - so c. 1,648 J per square meter per minute or 27.89333333 J per second at c. 20% efficiency gives 6 J per second
  c. 200 total - so c. 8368 J per square meter per minute 139.4666667 J per second at c. 20% efficiency gives 28 J per second

  c. 10% total on average
  c. 10% direct on average
  c. 20% difuse on average
